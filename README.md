# Ginger or Not?
 This is my first deep learning project. It is a computer vision project designed to identify if a picture contains ginger person or not.
 
 ## Repo files
 **.gitattributes:** Needed for pkl file  
 **Ginger Web App.ipynb:** Python script for deploying web application  
**Training.ipynb:** Python script for training the predictor  
**export.pkl:** Predictor  
**requirements.txt:** List of libraries needed to run 'Ginger Web App'  

 ## Data 
 The predictor is trained using picture labeled pictured of people (Ginger/Not Ginger). These were gathered using the duck duck go API.
 
 ## Software
Training was a done on Collab using fastai funtions.

## Deploying Web App
The web app is deployed using Voila and Binder.

## Results
Accuracy: 0.836207

## Conclusion
The accuracy isn't great considering the difficulty of the task. I found that binder is not consistant and that the link goes out of date over time. Next time I will try Heroku.
